Clarity Fitness is a local fitness studio that has taken much of its business virtual since March, including live
and on demand classes, as well as virtual private training. Its website is managed through Wordpress and is
fairly simple to maintain. They are looking for help with their virtual landing page to add media that is appealing
to the consumer. The project will consist of A/B testing to find the best experience with users. They currently
have about 40 members using their virtual platform and have a goal in 2021 to have 100 people using it. In
addition, their audio/video component for virtual classes is always a challenge and they welcome any and all
projects to improve that as well.
  
 Main.css and html is the newly improved code for the website's landing page. The login is for the login page of the website used to register in the clients.mindbodyonline.com subdomain. The class schedule is the new and improved class schedule format located in the  clients.mindbodyonline.com subdomain also. A/B Testing will also be added, but only to the original Clarity Fitness website, not this new modified version.

<h1>Contributions</h1>
<p>I was able to create various A/B testing experiences, such as removing the About Us section, Team section, or simplifying the navigation. The point of the landing page is to persuade more people to sign up for the Clarity Fitness classes, and my goal was to prioritize the "Register Now" button. I was able to collect A/B Testing data to see the most favorable choices that would attract the most clients and consumers. - Tony</p>

<p>I changed up the navigation of the website to make user friendly and less chaotic. Remove some things too and have the other group members add it to the footer as its known as "extra information". Later on there was another buttons added made the navigation more cluster (having the navigation out of shape and uneven) than it was but with my code i helped put it back in order. - Allan</p>

<p>To give the website a more appealing look, I redesigned the class schedule and login form for existing users. Visualization is very important when it comes to convincing people to navigate what's going on in the fitness so I made the color scheme and style similar to the homepage. I designed the menu (the one after clicking the "Register Now" button) with a simple modern look that makes the website more organized and attractive. - Melanie </p>

<p>I began to implement a dedicated about us section for the site in order to help free up more space on the main landing page. I also gave it a similar color shceme to the one seen on the homepage. - Alessandro</p>
