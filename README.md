<p>I was able to create various A/B testing experiences, such as removing the About Us section, Team section, or simplifying the navigation. The point of the landing page is to persuade more people to sign up for the Clarity Fitness classes, and my goal was to prioritize the "Register Now" button. I was able to collect A/B Testing data to see the most favorable choices that would attract the most clients and consumers. - Tony</p>

<p>I changed up the navigation of the website to make user friendly and less chaotic. Remove some things too and have the other group members add it to the footer as its known as "extra information". Later on there was another buttons added made the navigation more cluster (having the navigation out of shape and uneven) than it was but with my code i helped put it back in order. - Allan</p>
