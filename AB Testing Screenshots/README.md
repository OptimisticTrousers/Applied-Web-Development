These are the A/B testing screenshots. They show the 4 alternative A/B Test options. One is removing the "About Us" section. One is about removing the "Our Team" section. One is removing "Latest Articles". The last one is changing the landing page description, moving the "Register Now" button up, and deleting the last containter in the landing page. There are also screenshots of the original website so it's easier to see the differences between the various AB test options. There are also screenshots about how A/B testing was setup. I cloned the Clarity Fitness website and I was able to run an A/B Test on it. Unfortunately, since it's a locally hosted website, I was only able to show the different A/B Test options if I was able to modify the original Clarity Fitness website.
